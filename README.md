# Oil Craft
A Minecraft mod that allows you to play with oil and oil byproducts

## Plans
My plans for this mod is to make a wide variety of fuels and other oil products that can be refined from oil that spawns in wold.
A longer term plan is to create a way of making renewable "oil" but that's quite a ways off.

## Currently working
Refinery is mostly working, but you currently can only use it manually.

## Liscence
This mod is liscenced under the MIT Liscence.

## Modpacks
Go ahead, I do ask that you link to the Curse page (when I get around to getting that up).
